FunGuy’s Project Context- first draft
One-liner

FunGuy’s is a mobile-first RPG / strategy / gacha (“gotcha”) game where collectible fungal characters form teams with formation + synergy bonuses to beat AI/PvE content, with long-term plans for guilds, skins, events, and eventually PC support.

Product Vision
Core fantasy

Collect a roster of fungi heroes (humanoid or creature-style TBD), build synergistic teams, and climb increasingly difficult content through smart composition, upgrades, and long-term progression.

North-star goals

Strategy matters (formation, synergy, statuses, counters)

Content is data-driven (easy to add new characters/skills/enemies without code changes)

Mobile-first, but architected to port to PC later (Unity multi-platform)

Current Design Pillars
Gameplay pillars

Team formation & synergy: specific combinations (roles/elements/biomes/traits) boost performance.

Element / status system (not finalized): initial placeholder elements used in data (Nature/Rot/Frost/Ember/Astral).

PvE progression: stages → waves → rewards → stronger teams.

Gacha: banners, rates, pity. Odds must be visible for store compliance.

Long-term features (planned): guilds, guild bosses/raids, cosmetics/skins, seasonal events.

Differentiator

Fungi as a theme enables unique mechanics:

Mutation / traits (future): evolving traits rather than flat “ascension”

Symbiosis pair bonuses

Biome identity (forest, swamp, volcanic, arctic, urban mold, cosmic)

Enemy Worldbuilding

You have a defined direction for enemy content via 10 enemy factions (examples: Rotbound Legion, Cordyceps Dominion, Ashen Bloom, Pale Mycelium, etc.), designed to support:

Chapter progression

Event rotations

Guild raids

Endgame “rule-breaking” bosses

Team Roles & Responsibilities
Garrett (Design / Art)

Character design (fungi roster: silhouettes → final art)

Naming, visual identity, skins

Faction visuals, enemy designs

You (Engineering / Tech Lead)

Unity project framework

Data pipeline (JSON-driven content)

Battle simulator + UI flow

Save system

Build pipeline (Android first)

Git + Git LFS asset workflow

Tech Stack & Workflow
Engine & tools

Unity: main engine (mobile-first, later PC export)

VS Code: C# scripting

Android Studio: SDK/ADB/emulator + Logcat debugging

Git + Git LFS: repo + large assets

Repo shape (current)

Unity project is inside the repo (folder contains Assets/, Packages/, ProjectSettings/)

Data-driven content stored as JSON under Resources/GameData/ (MVP approach)

Core scripts organized under Assets/_Game/Scripts/...

Git hygiene (resolved)

Unity junk (Library/, Temp/, etc.) removed from tracking and purged from history using git-filter-repo.

Git LFS enabled for large binaries (audio/video/images/models).

Android emulator build-and-run confirmed working.

Game Architecture (Current)
Boot flow

Boot scene runs Bootloader.cs:

Loads JSON content into Game.Data

Loads/creates local save into Game.Save

Initializes services like Game.Gacha

Auto-routes to Home

Data-driven content (MVP)

characters.json: characters + enemies (defs)

skills.json: skills + effect lists

stages.json: stage waves + rewards

banners.json: gacha banners, rates, pity

Systems implemented (framework level)

Data load (Resources TextAssets)

Local save (PlayerPrefs JSON)

Gacha service (rates + pity)

Battle sim skeleton (speed-based turns, basic effects/statuses)

Scene skeleton: Boot, Home, Summon, Team, Battle (navigation framework underway)

Current Status
✅ Completed / Working

Boot scene loads successfully (“data loaded + save loaded”)

Android toolchain configured; emulator Build And Run succeeded

Repo successfully pushed after cleanup; LFS in place

🟡 In progress

Scene navigation/UI skeleton (Home → Summon/Team/Battle → Back)

Minimal UI for Summon/Team/Battle screens (functional buttons and display)

Immediate Roadmap
Day 1 (Project setup) — finishing touches

Confirm scene list in build profiles (Boot index 0)

Home UI with nav buttons

Back buttons in Summon/Team/Battle

Optional: basic debug UI + logs

Day 2 (Data + Save verification)

Summon screen UI:

Pull 1 / Pull 10

Show pulled character name/rarity

Deduct currency + save

Inventory list UI

Basic team selection (choose 5)

Day 3–4 (Battle MVP)

Battle scene that:

Builds player team from save

Builds enemy wave from stage data

Runs BattleSim

Displays win/lose + rewards

Next milestones

Equipment/items (optional)

More statuses + targeting rules

Synergy system hooks (formation bonuses)

Guild system (later)

Live ops support (later): remote config, server-side gacha, analytics

Store/Compliance Notes (Mobile Gacha)

If you sell randomized pulls: display rates in-app (Google Play + Apple requirement)

Privacy policy + Terms recommended before public release

Android first is a good plan; iOS second once stable

Naming & Branding (Working)

Working repo name: FunGuy’s (Working Name)

Final name TBD (keep package name stable once chosen)
